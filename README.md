When I read my professor’s, Dr. Robert E. McCulloch, “Bayesian CART Model Search,” the largest note I got from the article was that Metropolis-Hastings search Algorithm can set a bubble graph around the actual distribution, as well as increase the iid observation. With this theory, we can see convergences and find the smallest errors for this main distribution. Although the normal greedy algorithm in CART executes fast calculations, , it is too straightforward, which is why much of the useful observations are lost. This tradeoff inspires my interest to continue studying statistics. With three-and-a-half-years into my academic career, I decided to focus primarily on fields related to machine learning. To continue this goal and pursue the focus area, my near-term alternatives were to either gain work experience or further my education by pursuing a master’s degree in statistics. 
In my early education, I read and learned about statistical theory and techniques. Whilst undertaking my lower level courses in Principles of Programming (java), Object-Oriented Program & Data (java), and Principles of Programming with C++, the fundamental elements of these classes were of interest to me, which lie a good foundation for my future study. Supplementary reading has widened my horizons and encouraged me to examine elements above and beyond the 100 and 200 level courses. With my demonstrated aptitude for statistics, I am confident that University of California, Berkeley will hone my skills and turn me into a world class researcher. Upon completing the program at University of California, Berkeley, I plan to explore more machine learning because machine learning, if perfected, can be used to understand the world better, impact the world with practical applications, and predict the future. 
 
With the theoretical knowledge accumulated, I began to devote more effort to acquire research opportunities to enrich my research experience.  I became fascinated by Machine learning in my third year at Arizona State University. During my statistics course, our group spent three-months working on a project aimed to predict the price of round cut diamonds using various methods and a set of provided variables. We tested multiple methods in order to find the most fit model. After testing the different methods, we cleaned the data using R studio and split the data 75% as the training set and 25% as the testing set. Then, we set several variables as the influencing factors and compared the results using multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and native Bayesian. The comparison results of this project showed that multiple linear regression was far less accurate than random forest regression with respective RMSEs, and that native Bayesian is accurate when there are price requests and has other condition limitations of diamonds. As for the partial differential equation project, “Analyze How the Shape of Arrowhead Will Influence the Accuracy in the Air Fluent and Simulate the Aerodynamics of the Air,” I looked at some articles to get some inspiration about how site materialization in a gird depicts dynamic activity, and how to improve draft codes about polar coordinates based on cylindrical coordinates. Our research group tried the finite difference method, then we switched to the more complex finite volume method. In the last step, we changed from heat equation to air condition. The initial code is based on an easy 1D heat diffusion equation with finite difference method. From there, we altered the code to 2D heat equation with finite difference method, then to 2D heat equation with finite volume method. Once the code for the 2D heat equation with finite volume method is set up, we can attempt in to model out how an arrow influences the air wave condition. My research projects show that I now have experimental knowledge on how to carry out statistical problems with abundant background knowledge.
In addition to research experience, my internship and work experiences also gave me precious opportunities to apply academic knowledge. I completed a 3-month internship in big data government when I was a sophomore and participated in a city transport condition data analysis program as a data analysis assistant, where I worked to use enormous public bus tickets usage condition data to draft a histogram. I had to consider the age groups and define them as necessary for the program topic. Different data deletion caused different results. During this time, I learned many practical applications. Moreover, I also worked at a company in the security sector as a data analysis intern.  During this internship, I attempted to reduce the Fama-French 3-factor model code in Python and supported the data from the SQL stock database. I searched many coding websites and related papers, trying to understand the carding math logic of the Fama-French 3-factor model. In order to achieve this, I set my own thinking system of the model and it worked. With my fast learning skills and hard work, I eventually got the code to function at full capacity. 
All the above experience makes me realize that not only we need the improvement of traditional statistical algorithms, but also the new complicated algorithms in the ear of the big data. Mathematics and statistics are the foundation of all this. It is important for me to have further improvement in mathematical ability, the enhancement of programming ability and the accumulation of team work to solve practical problems. With all my knowledge and experience, I have a strong desire to purse higher education in Statistics. University of California, Berkeley stands out as an institution that offers a Master of Science in Statistics program.
